# macOSCameraCapture
Simple CLI utility to save off an image from every webcam connected to the macOS machine.

This utility is meant for research and testing purposes. It iterates over the connected webcams, and for each one captures an image and writes it to disk.

This utility does not try to be stealthy, so if you use it you will notice that the standard macOS camera light does come on.
